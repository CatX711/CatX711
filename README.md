# Hey! 👋 I'm Daniel!

Hello! 😀 I'm CatX711, or, you may (or most likely may not) know me as Daniel Catarig.
I'm a 12 year old kid, who's currently working a lot on his coding projects, supported by 
his father (tu2- go check him out. He codes some cool stuff! https://github.com/tu2).
I'm not sure how you stumbled upon my profile, but feel free to stay as long as you want.

# Taking a break: CATX711 OFFLINE.
I'm currently going to secondary school, so I can't really focus on my coding. That's not to say I WON'T program, but I won't program as much and I won't
be able to upload here as often. When I have free time, I certainly will though. who knows, maybe the future me will come back to this. :)

## How I started Programming and Various Stuff I've Done 💻

I wrote my first lines of code when I was around 6/7. I can still remember my dad trying to teach me some very basic python.
It must've been pretty hard, haha. Eventually, after half an hour of getting to know stuff, I managed to write
some extremely simple programs. It wasn't a lot, but back then, I felt like the smartest human alive.
Sadly, after that, I never really got back into programming. Until 2020.
My dad and I found a spare laptop in our garage, and I started using it to make python stuff.
Sadly, the laptop no longer works, but I can still remember some of the code. It was primitive, sure. But full of passion.
After that, I got bored again, and took a year long break. After that, I randomly had an idea to make a game about the...
Tardis, for... some reason? I don't know. Still, I had a blast making it, and recorded it all in something my dad had
told me about ever since 2020. Github! CatX711 was born!
I recorded as much stuff in there as possible, like Coffee Game and Forge-Battle, and plenty more was tucked away in PyCharm.
But, alas, after a solid 7 months or so, I got bored. Again. 🤦‍♂️
Recently, I got back into coding. It's been very fun, and I hope to not get bored of it anymore.
I love harnessing my imagination and knowledge of python to make my own little stories. 
My favourite things I have made are probably... The T.A.R.D.I.S series, Pie OS and it's revamped versions (which I have not uploaded to github... yet. Update: I have now!) and Generic Coffee Game, my first, proper, meaningful game that's kind of fun to play.

## Website!

Yes, I have a website (now multiple)! All coded by me on my own to test my html skills. I have the code in one of my repositories.
Sadly, though, I can't seem to get my css to work 😅.


# One Final Note

*haha python go brrrrrr 👨🏻‍💻*
