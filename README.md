- 👋 Hi, I’m @CatX711, and I'm using this template, made by the gods of GitHub themselves.
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things, eg. bookwriting, programming, drawing, ect.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing much, really. At least, not yet.
- 📫 How to send me messages: don't.
- Working on 'Learn Python' where I explain Python for beginners and add new things as I learn them.
- As I'm only 11, I'm not very good at these things, haha.
