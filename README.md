Hello! üòÄ I'm CatX711, or, you may (or most likely may not) know me as Daniel Catarig.
I'm a 12 year old kid, who's currently working a lot on his coding projects, supported by 
his father (tu2- go check him out. He codes some cool stuff! https://github.com/tu2).
I'm not sure how you stumbled upon my profile, but feel free to stay as long as you want.

## How I started Programming and Various Stuff I've Done üíª

I wrote my first lines of code when I was around 6/7. I can still remember my dad trying to teach me some very basic python.
It must've been pretty hard, haha. Eventually, after half an hour of getting to know stuff, I managed to write
some extremely simple programs. It wasn't a lot, but back then, I felt like the smartest human alive.
Sadly, after that, I never really got back into programming. Until 2020.
My dad and I found a spare laptop in our garage, and I started using it to make python stuff.
Sadly, the laptop no longer works, but I can still remember some of the code. It was primitive, sure. But full of passion.
After that, I got bored again, and took a year long break. After that, I randomly had an idea to make a game about the...
Tardis, for... some reason? I don't know. Still, I had a blast making it, and recorded it all in something my dad had
told me about ever since 2020. Github! CatX711 was born!
I recorded as much stuff in there as possible, like Coffee Game and Forge-Battle, and plenty more was tucked away in PyCharm.
But, alas, after a solid 7 months or so, I got bored. Again. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Recently, I got back into coding. It's been very fun, and I hope to not get bored of it anymore.
I love harnessing my imagination and knowledge of python to make my own little stories. 
My favourite things I have made are probably... The T.A.R.D.I.S series, Pie OS and it's revamped versions (which I have not uploaded to github... yet. Update: I have now!) and Generic Coffee Game, my first, proper, meaningful game that's kind of fun to play.

## "Funny" Coding

I've made some funny stuff over the time I've learned to code. I think the funniest ones are uploaded on here:
- There's the sentient computer in Pie Os 1986 Edition,

```
    elif answer == "NOSTALGIA":
        print("THERE'S NOT MUCH NOSTALGIA HERE, HUH.")
        sleep(3)
        print("YOU'RE JUST TALKING TO ME-")
        sleep(1)
        playsound('Microsoft Windows 95 Startup Sound.mp3')
        print("OKAY, THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED 'NOSTALGIA' ")
        sleep(3)
        print("I MISS THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN I WAS JUST A MERE CIRCUIT BOARD.")

```
- "paper üò±"
- The two secret versions of me I hide in my code sometimes

```
from tkinter import *
import random

# Not working because of course it fricking isnt üíÄ - dAniEl?

GAME_WIDTH = 700
GAME_HEIGHT = 700
SPEED = 50
SPACE_SIZE = 50
BODY_PARTS = 3
SNAKE_COLOUR = "#00FF00"
FOOD_COLOUR = "#FF0000"
BACKGROUND_COLOUR = "#000000"
```

```
# hey... other me. the really sensitive one? you there?
# i am NOT sensitive!
# alright there you are- uh, hey. why is there nothing here?
# there is something. scroll all the way to the end of the file lol
# why should i believe you?
# just shut up and do it already.
```
- "Adventure Game" because you can die so easily lol.

So yeah, there's a lotta' funny stuff!



### ‚≠êÔ∏è Things that inspire me! ‚≠êÔ∏è

My dad (of course), as my mum doesn't really like programming, and, weirdly enough... ctiptopper, the full stack developer, who follows me for some reason. Thanks for the follow, mate! üòâ

# One Final Note

*haha python go brrrrrr üë®üèª‚Äçüíª*
