# BIG NEWS!!!! :D

Guess what? GUESS WHAT?!!!
I've mastered the art of css and created a multipage, responsive website for a fictional
website designing company. And anyone can access it :D
And currently, I'm learning JavaScript (pray for me, it's almost too much for a 12 year old to handle), so I will
be implementing that in future websites.

Company name:

"Notable Inc. &copy;"

(Dont worry, notable inc isnt actually copyrighted.)

Don't question the name, its an auto generated one as I forgot to <br />
enter in my own url name, lol.

## How I started Programming and Various Stuff I've Done 💻

I wrote my first lines of code when I was around 6/7. I can still remember my dad trying to teach me some very basic python.
It must've been pretty hard, haha. Eventually, after half an hour of getting to know stuff, I managed to write
some extremely simple programs. It wasn't a lot, but back then, I felt like the smartest human alive.
Sadly, after that, I never really got back into programming. Until around 2020.
I found a spare laptop in our garage, and I started using it to make python stuff.
Sadly, the laptop no longer works, but I can still remember some of the code. It was primitive, sure. But full of passion.
After that, I got bored again, and took a year long break. After that, I randomly had an idea to make a game about the...
Tardis, for... some reason? I don't know. Still, I had a blast making it, and recorded it all in something my dad had
told me about ever since 2020. Github! CatX was born!
I recorded as much stuff in there as possible, like Coffee Game and Forge-Battle, and plenty more was tucked away in PyCharm.
But, alas, after a solid 7 months or so, I got bored. Again. 🤦‍♂️
Recently, I got back into coding. It's been very fun, and I hope to not get bored of it anymore.
I love harnessing my imagination and knowledge of programming to make my own little stories. And recently, I've moved on to more advanced things, like programming in Html, and CSS!
Have a great day ;D
