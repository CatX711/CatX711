# Hey! 👋 I'm Daniel!

Hello! 😀 I'm CatX711, or, you may (or most likely may not) know me as Daniel Catarig.
I'm a 12 year old kid, who's currently working a lot on his coding projects, supported by 
his father (tu2- go check him out. He codes some cool stuff!).
I'm not sure how you stumbled upon my profile, but feel free to stay as long as you want.

## How I started Programming and Various Stuff I've Done 💻

I wrote my first lines of code when I was around 6/7. I can still remember my dad trying to teach me some very basic python.
It must've been pretty hard, haha. Eventually, after half an hour of getting to know stuff, I managed to write
some extremely simple programs. It wasn't a lot, but back then, I felt like the smartest human alive.
Sadly, after that, I never really got back into programming. Until 2020.
My dad and I found a spare laptop in our garage, and I started using it to make python stuff.
Sadly, the laptop no longer works, but I can still remember some of the code. It was primitive, sure. But full of passion.
After that, I got bored again, and took a year long break. After that, I randomly had an idea to make a game about the...
Tardis, for... some reason? I don't know. Still, I had a blast making it, and recorded it all in something my dad had
told me about ever since 2020. Github! CatX711 was born!
I recorded as much stuff in there as possible, and plenty more was tucked away in PyCharm.
But, alas, after a solid 7 months or so, I bored. Again. 🤦‍♂️
Recently, I got back into coding. It's been very fun, and I hope to not get bored of it anymore.
I love harnessing my imagination and knowledge of python to make my own little stories.
My favourite things I have made are probably... The T.A.R.D.I.S series, Pie OS and it's revamped version (which I have not uploaded to github)
and Coffee Game, my first, proper, meaningful game that's kind of fun to play.

### ⭐️ Things that inspire me! ⭐️

My dad (of course), as my mum doesn't really like programming, and, weirdly enough... ctiptopper, the full stack developer, who follows me for some reason. Thanks for the follow, mate! 😉
